The data found in this project is from the [2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2023). This survey measures substance use, mental illness, and treatment in the civilian non-institutionalized population aged 12 or older. For the purposes of this project, however, I will only be focusing on adults.
